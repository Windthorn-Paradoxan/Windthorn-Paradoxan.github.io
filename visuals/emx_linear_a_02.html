    <h1>How the Meanings Were Derived</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      An EMx-based explanation of how Linear A signs were mapped to flow, containers, gates, cycles, and operators.
    </p>

    <!-- 1. Overview -->
    <h2>1. Big Picture: What Was Being Derived?</h2>
    <p>
      The goal was <span class="highlight">not</span> to guess words, but to recover what each Linear A sign does inside a
      procedural system: how it moves water, marks a container, gates a branch, or loops a cycle. EMx provides the
      ternary scaffolding; archaeological engineering provides the physical constraints.
    </p>
    <div class="pill-row">
      <span class="pill">Token → Sign shape & neighbors</span>
      <span class="pill">Topology → Where it sits in a network</span>
      <span class="pill">Time → How often & in what cycles it appears</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Meanings were derived by demanding that <strong>all three views agree at once</strong> for each sign:
      usage statistics, network role, and temporal/iterative behavior all had to align with a single engineering role
      and a single EMx operator slot.
    </p>

    <!-- 2. The Derivation Pipeline -->
    <h2>2. The Derivation Pipeline</h2>
    <div class="grid grid--3">
      <div class="card">
        <span class="badge">Step 1</span>
        <h3>Frequency & Clustering</h3>
        <p>
          Count where each sign appears, with which neighbors, and in what positions in a “line” of instructions.
          Symbols that cluster around flow-like patterns get tagged as FLOW; those that sit next to numeric or volume
          markers get tagged as CONTAINMENT, and so on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="badge">Step 2</span>
        <h3>Domain Assignment</h3>
        <p>
          Once clustered, each sign is placed into one of seven functional domains:
          FLOW, CONTAINMENT, EXCHANGE, POLARITY, RECURSION, STATE, or ECHO. The distribution has to match engineering
          reality (how often you need pipes vs tanks vs gates) and EMx’s expected balance of operators.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="badge">Step 3</span>
        <h3>EMx Operator Fit</h3>
        <p>
          Inside each domain, symbols are matched to EMx operators O₁–O₁₀ (lift, flux, closure, exchange, iteration, etc.)
          by looking at how they participate in patterns that behave like initialization, flow, junctions, loops,
          or checksums.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="badge">Step 4</span>
        <h3>Engineering Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          The resulting “sentences” are interpreted as engineering specs for pyramids, channels, reservoirs, and
          proto-aqueducts. The geometry (angles, gradients, volumes) must be physically sensible and match known
          Bronze Age capabilities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="badge">Step 5</span>
        <h3>Cross-Tablet Coherence</h3>
        <p>
          A symbol cannot mean “basin” on one tablet and “gate” on another if both appear inside equivalent structural
          patterns. The same sign must solve the same role across pyramid, irrigation, and aqueduct contexts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <span class="badge">Step 6</span>
        <h3>Error-Checking Layer</h3>
        <p>
          Echo symbols and tally marks are interpreted as quality-control operators. They must appear at the right
          structural checkpoints (after a loop, at the end of a build stage, etc.), or the derivation is rejected.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. Why These Domains -->
    <h2>3. Why These Seven Domains?</h2>
    <p>
      When you sort all 78 core symbols by behavior, they fall into seven stable families. Those families line up
      both with EMx layers and with how real infrastructure has to be described:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Domain</th>
          <th>What the Signs Actually Do</th>
          <th>EMx Layer</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>FLOW</td>
          <td>Mark channels, directions, drops, continuations of water or air.</td>
          <td>T₁ / O₂ (Flux)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>CONTAINMENT</td>
          <td>Describe vessels, basins, tanks, and storage volumes.</td>
          <td>T₀ / O₆ (Normalize)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>EXCHANGE</td>
          <td>Handle junctions, gates, branch points, and crossings.</td>
          <td>T₃ / O₇ (Exchange)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>POLARITY</td>
          <td>Encode paired channels, redundant paths, and mirrored states.</td>
          <td>T₃ / O₃ (Polarity)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>RECURSION</td>
          <td>Mark cycles, loops, and large-scale temporal patterns.</td>
          <td>T₁/T₂ / O₄, O₁₀</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>STATE</td>
          <td>Define measurements, names, materials, and fixed parameters.</td>
          <td>T₀ / O₁, O₅, O₈</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ECHO</td>
          <td>Track tallies, symmetry constraints, and validation checks.</td>
          <td>T₄ / O₉ (No-clone)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The percentages in each domain (e.g. ~21.8% containment symbols) match the expected proportion of
      “container/NULL” roles in EMx and in actual hydraulic design, which is one of the core “why” checks behind
      the mapping.
    </p>

    <!-- 4. Worked Derivation: HOL & WA -->
    <h2>4. Worked Example: How One Symbol Got Its Meaning</h2>
    <h3>Symbol 𐘱 HOL – “Primary Basin / Reservoir”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Token behavior:</strong> Appears where specifications talk about volumes, capacities, or starting points.</li>
      <li><strong>Topology:</strong> Sits at the top of cascades like 𐘱 → 𐘲 → 𐘸 (big basin → distribution → outputs).</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Often combined with iteration markers (cycles, seasonal operation) as the stable reference point.</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> The contexts read cleanly as a header tank or main reservoir feeding smaller elements.</li>
      <li><strong>EMx fit:</strong> This matches O₆ (Normalize) → “define bounds of the system” at a T₀ containment node.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because the same logic holds on pyramid, irrigation, and aqueduct tablets, the symbol 𐘱 is assigned the role
      <span class="highlight">HOL – main reservoir / whole basin</span> consistently.
    </p>

    <h3>Symbol 𐘦 WA – “Primary Water Flow”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Token behavior:</strong> Always part of flow strings like 𐘦 → 𐘁 or 𐘦 ⇒ 𐘧.</li>
      <li><strong>Topology:</strong> Occupies trunk positions in branching diagrams; other flow signs hang off it as branches.</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Tied to pulsed cycles (daily or seasonal), marking repeated releases.</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Fits perfectly as “main channel from source” in all three system types.</li>
      <li><strong>EMx fit:</strong> It is a textbook O₂ (Flux) carrier—pure gradient along one axis, feeding the rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 5. Pattern-Based “Why” -->
    <h2>5. Why These Meanings and Not Others?</h2>
    <div class="diagram">
Derivation filter:

1. Symbol-in-isolation is not enough.
2. Symbol-in-pattern must be consistent across many tablets.
3. Resulting "sentence" must describe a coherent build or flow.
4. Geometry must be physically plausible (angles, gradients, volumes).
5. EMx operator balance must stay intact across the whole system.

Only mappings that satisfy all 5 survive.
    </div>
    <p>
      If a proposed meaning makes one tablet look nice but breaks another (or destroys EMx balance), it gets discarded.
      The surviving meanings are those that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preserve stable domains across hundreds of lines of text.</li>
      <li>Produce realistic engineering designs when decoded into geometry.</li>
      <li>Keep EMx’s operator counts and layer distributions in their expected ranges.</li>
      <li>Allow error-checking symbols to appear exactly where a real engineer would put them.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 6. EMx Cross-Check -->
    <h2>6. EMx as the Consistency Check</h2>
    <p>
      EMx’s ternary lattice is the consistency filter sitting underneath the whole derivation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each symbol’s role maps to a unique slot in the 27-state lattice (token).</li>
      <li>Its connection pattern and domain placement map to a specific place in the network (topology).</li>
      <li>Its cyclic and iterative behavior maps to an operator on the timeline (time).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When those three projections agree, the meaning is “locked in”. When they disagree, the mapping is revised
      or discarded. That’s the “why” behind the final registry: it’s the smallest set of meanings that keeps
      everything internally rigid and externally plausible.
    </p>

    <!-- 7. How to Derive New Meanings -->
    <h2>7. How to Derive a New Symbol’s Meaning</h2>
    <p>If you want to repeat the process on a symbol that isn’t in the quick tables, the recipe is:</p>
    <ol style="margin-left:1.1rem; font-size:0.9rem; color:#d0d8ff;">
      <li>Collect every occurrence of the sign across tablets and note:
        <ul>
          <li>Its neighbors, its position in lines, and which domain symbols it appears with.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Assign a provisional domain (FLOW, CONTAINMENT, etc.) based on its “friends”.</li>
      <li>Check which EMx operator slots are still free or under-used in that domain.</li>
      <li>Test candidate roles by decoding full lines as engineering instructions.</li>
      <li>Reject any role that breaks geometry, timing, or EMx operator balance.</li>
      <li>Keep only the role that stays consistent across all contexts and layers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That derivation loop is why the meanings in the codec aren’t just narrative guesses; they’re the intersection
      of EMx structure, symbol statistics, and hard engineering constraints.
    </p>

    <p class="footer-note">
      This page is a conceptual summary of the derivation logic. The detailed symbol tables, domains, and worked
      engineering specs live in your codec and engineering documents; this is the “why it hangs together” layer.
